# pyvicon
This is a minimal python3 wrapper over Vicon Datastream SDK. It keeps the SDK structure and naming convention
as much as possible.

### Tested with OS :
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Tested with Vicon SDK :
- 1.7.0

Download Vicon Datastream SDK [here](https://www.vicon.com/downloads/utilities-and-sdk/datastream-sdk).

Put the .cpp and .h in pyvicon folder.
Put the library (.so) somewhere accessible for your os (ex: /usr/local/lib).

### Install
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### TODO
- Implement less "popular" functions

### Contribution
Always welcome!
